Getting started with ethical hacking as a beginner can be exciting and highly educational. Here are some beginner-friendly projects that can help you build practical skills in ethical hacking and cybersecurity:

1. Setting Up a Virtual Lab
Goal: Create a safe environment to practice hacking and security skills.
Tools: VirtualBox or VMware, Kali Linux, Metasploitable (for vulnerabilities).
Steps: Set up a virtual network with vulnerable systems (like Metasploitable or OWASP Broken Web Applications) and use Kali Linux tools to test various attacks. This is essential for safe experimentation and learning.
2. Network Scanning and Reconnaissance
Goal: Learn to use scanning tools to identify devices and open ports on a network.
Tools: Nmap, Zenmap (Nmap's GUI version).
Steps: Use Nmap to scan your virtual network. Practice using different scanning techniques (such as SYN scan, ping sweep, etc.) and analyze the results. This project helps you understand how networks are structured and what kind of information attackers look for.
3. Password Cracking
Goal: Understand common password vulnerabilities and how to secure against them.
Tools: John the Ripper, Hashcat.
Steps: Start with simple, local password files in your virtual environment (e.g., a list of weak passwords). Use password-cracking tools to test different methods, such as brute force and dictionary attacks. This can also teach you about password policies and the importance of strong passwords.
