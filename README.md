# Ethical-Hacking-projects-for-beginners
 In this project, we learn how to use Nmap, a powerful network scanning tool, to discover devices and services running on a local network. 
 Network scanning and enumeration are critical skills for ethical hackers, as they help in identifying potential targets and vulnerabilities within a network. 
 By the end of this project, you will be able to perform basic network scans, identify open ports, and gather information about the devices on your network using Kali Linux
